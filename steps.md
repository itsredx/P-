ðŸŸ¢ Iteration 2: Intermediate Representation (IR)
Goal: Translate AST into a structured IR
âœ… Define the IR structure
âœ… Implement an IR generator from the AST
âœ… Add error handling for invalid AST inputs
âœ… Test the IR generation with sample inputs

ðŸŸ¢ Iteration 3: Code Generation & Optimization
Goal: Convert IR into LLVM IR and optimize
âœ… Implement LLVM IR generation
âœ… Apply basic optimizations (constant folding, dead code elimination)
âœ… Compile and run a simple test program

Iteration 4: Implement Memory Management Strategies

Goals:

    Design Manual Memory Management:
    Implement allocation and deallocation functions that provide fine-grained control over memory (similar to C/C++), including RAII patterns.
    Integrate Optional Garbage Collection:
    Develop a garbage collector (e.g., generational mark-and-sweep or incremental GC) that can manage memory automatically when desired.
    Ensure Correctness and Performance:
    Define clear ownership rules, memory safety checks, and integrate these into the runtime environment.
